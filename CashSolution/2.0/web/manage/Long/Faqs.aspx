  So long as your application and all the required documentation are received, approval takes only a few hours - applications received by 2 p.m. EST will be processed the same day. </p>
								  <p><strong>How soon can I receive a cash advance? </strong><br>
  Funds are deposit into your bank account over night once your application is approved.

Golden Bridge Cash Solution TM cannot be held responsible for the failure of your bank to process the fund transfer in a timely manner. </p>
								  <p><strong>How do I receive the cash, and how do I repay the loan? </strong><br>
  We transfer money electronically. You pay us back by hassle-free direct debit from your account on the agreed payment day(s). You don't need to worry about anything more than ensure you have enough money in your account on the due date. This service allows you to privately receive your loan without leaving your home. </p>
								  <p><strong>What if I can't pay the loan on the due date?</strong> <br>
  If an emergency arises and you are unable to pay your installment on the due date, please contact our office immediately for arranging your alternative repayment option. </p>

<div class="p2">13.2	Without limiting the generality of clause 13.1, to the extent that any of the terms and conditions of this Credit Contract have, for any reason, the effect of preventing this Credit Contract from being characterised as a continuing credit contract for the purposes of the Consumer Credit Code, those terms and conditions are to be read as though they were varied to the extent necessary to ensure that this Credit Contract may be so characterised as a continuing credit contract under the Consumer Credit Code.</div>

<div class="p2">15.3	In the event that we do not charge any fee which we are entitled to charge to your Account under this Credit Contract, that decision to not charge the fee on that instance does not constitute a waiver of that fee or Charge for any other occasion.</div>
<div class="p2">15.4	Any forbearance, failure or delay in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Credit Contract does not vary the terms and conditions of this Credit Contract unless we notify you in writing that we have done so. </div>

<div class="p2NoIndex">The Terms and Conditions and Financial Table, as varied pursuant to clause 11 from time to time, represent the entire agreement between us and, subject to any mandatory laws applicable to this Credit Contract, no other statements, promises or implications whether oral or in writing, by electronic media or otherwise, shall be taken to be part of this Credit Contract or enforceable as a representation under this Credit Contract.</div>

<br/><br/>
INFORMATION STATEMENT<br/>
PROPOSED CREDIT CONTRACT 
<div class="p2NoIndex">This statement tells you about some of the rights and obligations of yourself and your credit provider. </div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">It does not state the terms and conditions of your contract. If you have any concerns about your contract, contact your credit provider and, if you still have concerns, your credit provider's external dispute resolution scheme, or get legal advice.</div>
THE CONTRACT 
<div class="p1">1. How can I get details of my proposed credit contract? </div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">Your credit provider must give you a precontractual statement containing certain information about your contract. The precontractual statement, and this document, must be given to you before:</div>
<div class="p2">(a) your contract is entered into; or </div>
<div class="p2">(b) you make an offer to enter into the contract; </div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">whichever happens first. </div>
<div class="p1">2. How can I get a copy of the final contract? </div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">If the contract document is to be signed by you and returned to your credit provider, you must be given a copy to keep. Also, the credit provider must give you a copy of the final contract within 14 days after it is made. This rule does not, however, apply, if the credit provider has previously given you a copy of the contract document to keep.</div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">If you want another copy of your contract write to your credit provider and ask for one. Your credit provider may charge you a fee. Your credit provider has to give you a copy:</div>
<div class="p2">(a) within 14 days of your written request if the original contract came into existence 1 year or less before your request; or</div>
<div class="p2">(b) otherwise within 30 days of your written request. </div>
<div class="p1">3. Can I terminate the contract? </div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">Yes. You can terminate the contract by writing to the credit provider so long as:</div>
<div class="p2">(a) you have not obtained any credit under the contract; or </div>
<div class="p2">(b) a card or other means of obtaining credit given to you by your credit provider has not been used to acquire goods or services for which credit is to be provided under the contract.</div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">However, you will still have to pay any fees or charges incurred before you terminated the contract. </div>
<div class="p1">4. Can I pay my credit contract out early? </div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">Yes. Pay your credit provider the amount required to pay out your credit contract on the day you wish to end your contract.</div>
<div class="p1">5. How can I find out the pay out figure? </div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">You can write to your credit provider at any time and ask for a statement of the pay out figure as at any date you specify. You can also ask for details of how the amount is made up. Your credit provider must give you the statement within 7 days after you give your request to the credit provider. You may be charged a fee for the statement.</div>
<div class="p1">6. Will I pay less interest if I pay out my contract early? </div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">Yes. The interest you can be charged depends on the actual time money is owing. However, you may have to pay an early termination charge (if your contract permits your credit provider to charge one) and other fees.</div>
<div class="p1">7. Can my contract be changed by my credit provider?</div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">Yes, but only if your contract says so. </div>
<div class="p1">8. Will I be told in advance if my credit provider is going to make a change in the contract?</div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">That depends on the type of change. For example:</div>
<div class="p2">(1) you get at least same day notice for a change to an annual percentage rate. That notice may be a written notice to you or a notice published in a newspaper.</div>
<div class="p2">(2) you get 20 days advance written notice for:</div>
<div class="p2">(a) a change in the way in which interest is calculated; or</div>
<div class="p2">(b) a change in credit fees and charges; or </div>
<div class="p2">(c) any other changes by your credit provider,except where the change reduces what you have to pay or the change happens automatically under the contract.</div>
<div class="p1">9. Is there anything I can do if I think that my contract is unjust? </div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">Yes. You should first talk to your credit provider. Discuss the matter and see if you can come to some arrangement.</div>
<div class="p2NoIndex">If that is not successful, you may contact your provider's external dispute resolution scheme. External dispute resolution is a free service established to provide you with an independent mechanism to resolve specific complaints.</div>

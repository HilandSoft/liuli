<strong>How much can I borrow?</strong><br>
All requests for loans will be considered on their merits. We will evaluate 
your loan application to ensure that you are capable of repaying the loan. You 
can usually borrow up to 30% of your take home pay and to maximum $1,500. For a 
first time borrower you can usually borrow up to $500.</p>
<p>The minimum loan amount is $50.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How long can I borrow for?</strong><br>
	The term of the loan is maximum two months or three pay periods (whichever is 
	the sooner). Repayment can be made in maximum of 3 installments. Each 
	installment is due on your payday.
	<br>
	For loan less than $100, one installment only.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>What if I have poor credit?</strong><br>
	There is never a credit check. As long as you have regular income, in most 
	cases, we can help. If you have questions about your eligibility for a loan, 
	learn more about how our <a href="how-it-works">payday advance loan</a> works, 
	or contact <a href="Contact-Us">Golden Bridge Cash Solution</a> &#8482;. In 
	fact, it will help you to re-build your creditworthiness if you always pay off 
	your loan on time. We are happy to supply confirmation of this.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How long does the approval process take? </strong>
	<br>
	For first time borrower, so long as your application and all the required 
	documentation are received, approval takes only a few hours - applications 
	received by 2 p.m. EST will be processed the same day. Members will be even 
	easier and quicker.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How soon can I receive a cash advance?</strong><br>
	Funds are deposit into your bank account over night once your application is 
	approved. The funds are normally available very next working day; however, it 
	is subject how quickly your bank processes the funds. Golden Bridge Cash 
	Solution &#8482; cannot be held responsible for the failure of your bank to 
	process the <a href=".">cash advance</a> fund transfer in a timely manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p><strong>How do I receive the cash, and how do I repay the loan?</strong><br>
	We transfer money electronically. You pay us back by hassle-free direct debit 
	from your account on the agreed payment day(s). You dont need to worry about 
	anything more than ensure you have enough money in your account on the due 
	date. This service allows you to privately receive your loan without leaving 
	your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What if I can't pay the loan on the due date?</strong><br>
  If you can not make a payment, you should contact us  immediately. Depending on your circumstances, we may make changes to the  repayments under your contract to help you repay the debt. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What documentation do I need?</strong><br>
	If you are a first time borrower with Golden Bridge Cash Solution &#8482;, you 
	will need all of the documentation mentioned in how to apply of How it Works 
	section of our website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>I don't have a bank or credit union or any other account?</strong><br>
	Unfortunately, if this is the case we cannot help you. We have no way of 
	crediting your account as we do not deal in physical cash.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>I cannot get access to a fax machine to send over the application and 
		documents. Where can I go?</strong><br>
	Fax facilities are usually available at public libraries (<a href="http://www.nla.gov.au/libraries/" target="_parent">www.nla.gov.au/libraries/</a>
	) and main post offices (<a href="http://www.auspost.com.au" target="_parent">www.auspost.com.au</a>
	) as well as MBE business service centres (<a href="http://www.mbe.com.au" target="_parent">www.mbe.com.au</a>
	). Some convenience stores also have a fax service.<br>
	<br>
	SCAN: Alternatively, you can scan and email the signed application form and 
	documentation.
	<br>
	<br>
	POST: If none of the above is practicable, alternatively you can post the 
	application and documents to us. If you urgently need the money then try using 
	Express Post / Express Post Platinum for next business day delivery and we will 
	put cash into your account once approved. See www.auspost.com.au for more 
	details on the Express Post service.</p>
<p><strong>What is the cost of a cash loan?</strong><br>
	Please refer to our <a href="file:///C|/Users/golden bridge/AppData/Roaming/Macromedia/Dreamweaver 8/Configuration/Temp/FlashElements/ImageViewer/Costs-And-Fees">Costs &amp; Fees</a> section for more information on <a href="Costs-And-Fees">
		cash loan</a> fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are there any early repayment fees?</strong><br>
	No, you can pay back the loan as soon as you like without penalty. You will 
	need to contact us regarding the required payment, as finance cost will be 
	calculated daily up to the date of repayment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	give specific reasons for this, but wherever possible they will try and get 
	your loan approved.</P>
